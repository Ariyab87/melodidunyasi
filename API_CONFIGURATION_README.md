# API Configuration Status

## Overview
The API has been re-enabled for this application. All song generation, voice cloning, and video animation features are now available.

## What's Enabled
- ✅ Song generation API calls
- ✅ Voice cloning API calls  
- ✅ Video animation API calls
- ✅ Provider health checks
- ✅ Status polling

## How It's Configured
The API is enabled by setting `API_DISABLED = false` in `lib/api.ts`. This enables:

1. **API_ORIGIN** to point to the actual API URL (`https://melodidunyasi.onrender.com`)
2. All API functions to make real API calls
3. Users to access all song generation features

## User Experience
When the API is enabled:

1. **Full Functionality**: All song generation features are available
2. **Form Submission**: Users can submit forms and generate songs
3. **Real-time Processing**: Live status updates and progress tracking
4. **Complete Integration**: Full backend API integration is active

## To Disable the API
1. Set `API_DISABLED = true` in `lib/api.ts`
2. Add back the warning banner and toast notifications
3. Update error handling for disabled state
4. Test that API calls are properly blocked

## Current Configuration
- **API_DISABLED**: `false`
- **API_ORIGIN**: `https://melodidunyasi.onrender.com`
- **API_BASE**: `https://melodidunyasi.onrender.com/api`
- **SUNO_API_KEY**: `1111111111111111`

## Files Modified
- `lib/api.ts` - Main API configuration and functions
- `app/page.tsx` - Removed API disabled banner and toast notifications
- `.env` - Updated Suno API key configuration

## Testing
To test the enabled state:
1. Try submitting a song generation form
2. Check that API calls are made successfully
3. Verify song generation works properly
4. Confirm real-time status updates

## Notes
- The frontend application is fully functional
